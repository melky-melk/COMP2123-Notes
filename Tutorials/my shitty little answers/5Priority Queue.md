**Problem 1**. Come up with an instance showing that selection-sort takes Ω(n 2 ) time in the worst case.



**Problem 2**. Come up with an instance showing that insertion-sort takes Ω(n 2 ) time in the worst case.



**Problem 3**. Come up with an instance showing that heap-sort takes Ω(n log n) time in the worst case.

assuminbg being the min-heap sort being

{5,4,3,2,1}



**Problem 4**. Given an array A with n integers, an inversion is a pair of indices i < j such that A[i] > A[j]. Show that the in-place version of insertion-sort runs in O(n + I) time where I is the total number of inversions.



**Problem 5**. Given an array A with n distinct integers, design an O(n log k) time algorithm for finding the kth value in sorted order.



**Problem 6**. Given k sorted lists of length m, design an algorithm that merges the list into a single sorted lists in O(mk log k) time.
